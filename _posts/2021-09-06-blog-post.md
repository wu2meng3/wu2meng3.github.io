[MDPI Materials Special Issue](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials/special_issues/Density_Functional_Theory_Computational_Materials_Design)

I am very glad to be a guest editor for the Special Issue in MDPI Materials: "Recent Advances in Density Functional Theory and Computational Materials Design".

This Special Issue is focused on computational materials design with DFT and DFT-based methods. This field is quickly evolving, and we aim to present the recent advances in computational materials research where exciting new materials and phenomena are investigated by DFT and/or DFT-based methods. We also welcome articles or reviews on high-throughput computing, materials database, as well as the application of machine learning in materials design. It is my pleasure to invite you to submit a manuscript for this Special Issue. Full papers, communications, and reviews are all welcome.

Submission deadline is 04/10/2022. If you are interested, please contact me at wu1meng2@berkeley.edu. A 20% ~ 30% discount for the article processing charge is availabe upon invitation.
